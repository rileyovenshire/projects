This folder contains a collection of projects that I completed in CS 450: Intro to Computer Graphics. 

This was my first exposure to computer graphics and OpenGL in general, so some things may be a little shaky but I am rather proud of some of them. In the future, I will try to include some screenshots or links to the video descriptions of each one of the projects. 

Each file can be run by opening the .sln and running the sample.cpp file. 

All of these files have started from the gracious support of Mike Bailey at Oregon State! His sample/skeleton code set these up for me, and I just added the objects and animation. All credit and a great deal of thanks to him. His class really ignited a passion for me.
