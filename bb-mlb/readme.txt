Welcome to Better Better, an ML-driven betting advice model for the MLB!

General Information
    Better Better is a model that will allow a user to get well-informed tips on bets that they should make on MLB games, using machine learning.
    Currently, the model supports Moneyline bets, but is planned to be expanded upon in the future. Odds are pulled from
    FanDuel and Draft Kings, and all baseball-related statistics are pulled from Baseball Reference (see sources for more details).
