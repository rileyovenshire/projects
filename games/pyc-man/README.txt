This is my first ever game that I have developed, so it was a huge learning process and I definitely needed some help along the way.
This was created using PyGame and Aseprite.

Each file should have a solid amount of documentation included, there are docstrings that detail what I was trying to accomplish on each method.
Comments are there, but limited, as I wanted to make sure they weren't clogging the code. Again, this was a total learning process so bear with me!

This project would NOT have been possible if it weren't for the incredible guide that was put out on this site. I want to give this developer full credit for their efforts
and I would like to sincerely thank them for making game development journeys come to life.

Planned updates:
- New music
- New sprites
- New mazes
