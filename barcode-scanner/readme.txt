Source: https://pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/21/an-opencv-barcode-and-qr-code-scanner-with-zbar/

barcode_scanner_img.py: Scans single image barcode and QR codes in real-time with OpenCV and ZBar.
barcode_scanner_vid.py: Scans video barcode and QR codes in real-time with OpenCV and ZBar.
    - Currently supports video files and webcam, saves output to file.

Future implementations may include:
    - Direct output to SQL database
    - Direct cloud storage of output
    - Email/text support

This would not have been possible without the help of Adrian Rosebrock and his PyImageSearch blog, all credit to him.
