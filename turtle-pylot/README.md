# TurtlePylot

TurtlePylot is an interactive drawing application built using Python's Turtle graphics library, allowing users to control a turtle to draw various shapes and patterns on the screen. The program offers a blend of keyboard-driven commands and a simple GUI for color and drawing options, making it a versatile tool for creating digital art and learning programming fundamentals.

## Features

- **Movement Control**: Use arrow keys to move the turtle around the screen.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Hold the spacebar to boost the turtle's movement speed.
- **Shape Drawing**: Select predefined shapes to draw on the canvas.
- **Color Selection**: Choose a pen color via a color picker dialog.
- **Line Thickness**: Adjust the thickness of the lines drawn by the turtle.

## How It Works

TurtlePylot utilizes the Python Turtle graphics library, which provides an easy-to-use and intuitive way to create graphical applications. Users interact with the program through keyboard inputs for navigation and a graphical user interface (GUI) for drawing and customization options.

### Keyboard Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the turtle in the corresponding direction.
- **Spacebar**: Temporarily increase the turtle's movement speed.
- **R Key**: Clear the screen and reset the turtle to its starting position.
- **D Key**: Activate a "dance" mode, making the turtle move in a random pattern.

### GUI Options

- **Shape Selection**: Choose from a dropdown menu to have the turtle draw a circle or square.
- **Color Picker**: Open a dialog to select a color for the turtle's pen.
- **Line Thickness**: Use a slider to adjust the thickness of the lines drawn.

## Installation

To run TurtlePylot, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone or download this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script:

## Credits

TurtlePylot is built using Python's [Turtle graphics library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), a standard Python library developed by the Python Software Foundation. Turtle graphics is inspired by the Logo programming language, designed for educational purposes to introduce concepts of programming and computer graphics to beginners.

## Future Updates

- **Custom Shapes**: Allow users to define and draw their custom shapes.
- **Save Functionality**: Implement an option to save the current drawing to an image file.
- **Undo/Redo Actions**: Add undo and redo functionality to revert or reapply recent actions.
- **Enhanced GUI**: Improve the graphical user interface for a more intuitive and feature-rich experience.
- **Animation Support**: Introduce basic animation capabilities to bring drawings to life.
